# CellFishing.jl ê™® ðŸŽ£

CellFishing.jl (**cell** **fi**nder via ha**shing**) is a tool to find similar
cells of query cells based on their transcriptome expression profiles.

```julia
# Import packages.
using CellFishing
using CSV

# Load expression profiles of database cells.
data = CSV.read("database.txt", delim='\t')
cellnames = string.(names(data))
featurenames = string.(data[:,1])
counts = Matrix(data[:,2:end])

# Select features and create an index (or a database).
features = CellFishing.selectfeatures(counts, featurenames)
database = CellFishing.CellIndex(counts, features, metadata=cellnames)

# Save/load the database to/from a file (optional).
# CellFishing.save("database.cf", database)
# run(`gzip database.cf`)  # or run(`zstd database.cf`)
# database = CellFishing.load("database.cf.gz")

# Load expression profiles of query cells.
data = CSV.read("query.txt", delim='\t')
cellnames = string.(names(data))
featurenames = string.(data[:,1])
counts = Matrix(data[:,2:end])

# Search the database for similar cells; k cells will be returned per query.
k = 10
neighbors = CellFishing.findneighbors(k, counts, featurenames, database)

# Write the neighboring cells to a file.
open("neighbors.tsv", "w") do file
    println(file, join(["cell"; string.("n", 1:k)], '\t'))
    for j in 1:length(cellnames)
        print(file, cellnames[j])
        for i in 1:k
            print(file, '\t', database.metadata[neighbors.indexes[i,j]])
        end
        println(file)
    end
end
```

## Installation

First of all, you need to install a Julia compiler.  A recommended way to
install Julia is downloading pre-built binaries. The pre-built binaries of Julia
for several major platforms are distributed at
<https://julialang.org/downloads/>.  Currently, CellFishing.jl supports Julia
0.6 and 0.7 (beta). Then, install CellFishing.jl with the following command:

    $ julia -e 'Pkg.clone("https://github.com/bicycle1885/CellFishing.jl")'

To check the installation, you can try `using CellFishing` in your REPL:

    $ julia
